üß† Image Classification using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

üîç Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **TensorFlow** to classify images. CNNs are widely used in computer vision tasks due to their ability to automatically and efficiently learn spatial hierarchies in images.

üìÇ Dataset  
- Default: **CIFAR-10** or **MNIST** (customizable)  
- Contains: Labeled image data  
- Classes: (e.g., Airplane, Car, Cat, Dog, etc.)

üõ† Technologies Used  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **IDE**: Google Colab 

üß± Model Architecture  
- **Input Layer**: Accepts image data  
- **Conv2D Layers**: With ReLU activation  
- **MaxPooling2D Layers**: For down-sampling  
- **Flatten Layer**: Converts matrix to vector  
- **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers for classification  
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for multiclass classification  

üìä Workflow  
1. Load and preprocess the image dataset  
2. Build CNN architecture using TensorFlow/Keras  
3. Compile the model with optimizer and loss function  
4. Train the model on the dataset  
5. Evaluate and visualize accuracy & loss  

üöÄ How to Run  
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Image-Classification-CNN.git  
   cd Image-Classification-CNN  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Run the notebook  
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook CNN_Image_Classification.ipynb  
   ```  

üìå Results  
- Achieved classification accuracy on test dataset  
- Visualized sample predictions and training performance  

üîÆ Future Enhancements  
- Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting  
- Train on custom datasets (e.g., dogs vs. cats)  
- Experiment with transfer learning using pre-trained models
